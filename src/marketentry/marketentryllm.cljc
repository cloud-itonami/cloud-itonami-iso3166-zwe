(ns marketentry.marketentryllm
  "MarketEntry-LLM client -- the *contained intelligence node* for
  the Zimbabwe (ZWE) public-sector market-entry compliance actor.

  It normalizes engagement intake, drafts a per-jurisdiction market-
  entry evidence checklist, drafts the filing-draft action, and drafts
  the filing-submit action. CRITICAL: it is a smart-but-untrusted
  advisor. It returns a *proposal* (with a rationale + the fields it
  cited), never a committed record or a real portal submission. Every
  output is censored downstream by `marketentry.governor` before
  anything touches the SSoT, and `:filing/draft`/`:filing/submit`
  proposals NEVER auto-commit at any phase -- see README Actuation.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end."
