  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the Zimbabwe (ZWE) market-entry
  compliance actor.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- engagement intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-assess  -- adds jurisdiction assessment writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:engagement/intake` (no portal-
                                 facing risk yet) may auto-commit.
                                 `:filing/draft`/`:filing/submit`
                                 NEVER auto-commit, at any phase.

  `:filing/draft`/`:filing/submit` are deliberately ABSENT from
  every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent
  structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Drafting a
  real portal package and submitting a real portal registration are
  the two real-world acts this actor performs; both are always a
  human market-entry operator's call. `marketentry.governor`'s
  `:actuation/draft-filing`/`:actuation/submit-filing` high-stakes
  gate enforces the same invariant independently -- two layers, not
  one, agree on this.")
