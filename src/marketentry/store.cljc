  "SSoT for the Zimbabwe (ZWE) market-entry compliance actor, behind a
  `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same
  seam every prior cloud-itonami actor in this fleet uses.

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store.

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/marketentry/store_contract_test.clj).

  The primary entity here is an `engagement` -- filing-draft and
  filing-submit actuation events apply SEQUENTIALLY to the SAME
  engagement record (draft first, submit later). Dedicated
  double-actuation-guard booleans (`:drafted?`/`:submitted?`, never a
  `:status` value).

  The ledger stays append-only on every backend."
