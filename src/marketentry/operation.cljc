(ns marketentry.operation
  "OperationActor -- one market-entry operation = one supervised
  actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor
  (MarketEntry-LLM) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its
  proposal is ALWAYS routed through the Market-Entry Compliance
  Governor (:govern) and the rollout phase gate (:decide) before
  anything commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next seam)
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)

  One graph run = one market-entry operation. No unbounded inner loop.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor.
  `:filing/draft`/`:filing/submit` ALWAYS reach this node when the
  governor is clean -- see `marketentry.phase`."
